# Crazazy's personal nixos configuration and package repository

![CI](https://github.com/crazazy/nixos-config/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Hello!

I'm Crazazy, and nowadays I mostly work on nix projects in my free time

Currently I study at the [University of Twente](https://utwente.nl)

In this git repo you will find my personal configuration, and some packages I find useful to have

### folders:

- `pkgs/`: personal package repository
- `modules/`: nixos modules for my current laptop
- `local/`: configuration files that are not written in nix
- `overlays/`: overlay functions, neatly sorted by priority
- `lib/`: small library functions. Most of them were used while I was still doing AoC 2020.

### main files:

- `configuration.nix` nixos config entrypoint. this repository lives in my /etc/nixos
- `createLinks.sh`: creates links to my local config directory. Right now I'm not using home-manager     as some of these configs are automatically written by GUI's
- `default.nix`: setup for the monorepo

### copying this system setup

- install [NixOS](https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/)
- replace configuration.nix with the following:
```nix
{ ... }:
let
    nur-no-pkgs = import (builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/nix-community/NUR/archive/master.tar.gz") {};
    inherit (nur-no-pkgs.repos.crazazy.modules.private) desktop-configuration system-configuration users-configuration;
in
{
    imports = [
        desktop-configuration
        system-configuration
        accounts-configuration
        ./hardware-configuration.nix
        ];
}
```

then run `createLinks.sh` do create symlinks to configurations managed in the repository

### Additional notes:

- You need a nixpkgs source (or at least a source that implements nixpkgs library functions `extends`, `flip`, `fix` and `mapAttrs`) to use the overlays in this repository via NUR.
- If you want to use this as a `<nixpkgs>` source, its best to first clone this repository, then enter the command `git submodule update --init --depth 1 dep/nixpkgs` so that you don't download the nixpkgs source with all git history attached.

### Installing packages faster

This repository uses [cachix](https://cachix.org) to cache the build artifacts nix created. To use the built derivations just put the following in your command line:
```sh
nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install
cachix use crazazy
```
